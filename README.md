# Python-Startersguide

This guide is meant to learn you the basics for Python on PLCnext. We'll learn how to run your Python code, build applications that can acces the data-variables from our PLCnext Engineer project. We can acces the variables in two ways, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The REST interface can be considerd less cumbersome to set for a few variables. Accessing the variables on the OPC UA server is a bit more difficult to set up but supports a lot more functions.
